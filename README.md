# MICROCONTROLLER - MICROPROCESSOR  
## LABORATORY 4: LAB4_SCHEDULER
## 1. Schematic
The code was simulated in **Proteus 8.10** using STM32F103C6. Here are the simulation of exercises.

# 3. How to run the exercises source code?
1. Ensure that all hardware connections are correct as described above. The timer is configured with prescaler = 7999, counter = 9 so the TICK is 10 ms.
2. Clone this Project and Run.
